This is not yet JP+ Stations, but I'm working on the sprites - and maybe there will be some advanced stuff added in the future (auto platforms, buffers, also passenger and cargo on station platforms, etc.)

This set features a set of Japanese style platforms. Some of them are not based on Japanese stations though, rather they are based off SkyTrain systems.

## Features

- JP+ Tracks compatibility
  - Fences
