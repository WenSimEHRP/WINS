# JP+ WINS Stations

Designed to replace JP3 Stations; served with smart autoplatforms and fences.

## Building

To build the GRF, you should have these subjects installed;

- bash
- nml
- gcc
- python

Note: you should be able to access `bash` after you installed `git` if you are on Windows.\
You could use `install_dependencies.sh` to quickly install nml and its requirements.

Please note that this grf requires the latest version of NML. It is recommended to install
NML through the install script.

After having all dependencies installed, you should be able to build the grf by running `build.sh`.

Additionally, you can create a release package by running `bash build.sh release`, or, a compressed archive by running `bash build.sh pack`. Note that `xz` is required for the latter operation.
